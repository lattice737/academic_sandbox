/*
Vocabulary
==========
* First In First Out (FIFO) - A policy where the first item in a collection is the first to be removed
* Queue - A collection of items characterized by FIFO behavior
* Simulation - a technique for analyzing the behavior of complex systems by modeling that behavior
* Back - the point of entry for a queue
* Front - the exit point of a queue
* Priority value - a representation of importance for determining a priority queue's operations
* Priority queue - a queue that performs its operations based on its items' priority values
* Event-driven simulation - the generation of events using a statistics-based mathematical model to represent long-term behavior of
  a system; it is characterized by consideration only of certain events times
* Externally-generated events - simulation events that are specified by input
* Internally-generated events - simulation events that are predetermined by the simulation
* Event loop - the repeated determination of event occurrence and processing for a simulation
* Time-driven simulation - a simulation based on a time series (e.g. pseudorandom)
* Event queue - a priority queue that contains all future events
* Position-oriented ADTs - collection data types with operations defined in terms of their items' positions (i.e. stack, list, queue)
* Value-oriented ADTs - collection data types with value-based operations (i.e. sorted list, priority queue)

General
=======
~ Queues are appropriate for many realistic models, including waiting and simulation
~ Queues may also execute FIFO behavior based on criteria other than chronology (e.g. priority)
~ Queue operations only occur at its ends
~ Generally, the goal of a simulation is to generate statistics that summarize the performance of an existing system or to predict
  the performance of a proposed system
~ The ADT bag does not order its entries, nor is it position-oriented or value-oriented
