using namespace std;

/*
Vocabulary
==========
* Tail pointer - a dedicated pointer used to reference the node on the end of a chain in a link-based implementation
  of the queue (avoiding the need to traverse for access)
* Linear chain - a link-based implementation that models a one-dimensional sequence of nodes, regardless of external
  pointers
* Circular chain - a link-based implementation where the last node points to the first node; for a queue, this means
  only a back pointer is required

General
=======
~ None of the nodes in a circular chain point to the nullptr
