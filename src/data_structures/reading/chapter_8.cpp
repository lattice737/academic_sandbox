/*
Vocabulary
==========
* List - an ordered container of items with the same type and positions referenced by number
* Predecessor - the item positioned before a given list item
* Successor - the item positioned after a given list item
* Head - the first item of a list--has no predecessor
* Tail - the last item of a list--has no successor
* Insertion sort - Sorting items of a container as they are inserted
* Trusted code - code that presumably functions correctly--usually the private methods of an
  ADT
* 

General
=======
~ The first entry in a list has position 1--not 0, as in an array
~ List operation categories:
  1) insert - adds data to a collection
  2) remove - removes data from a collection
  3) questions - i.e. isEmpty(), getLength(), getEntry()
  * replace removes an item and then adds a different item
~ A set of axioms, preconditions, and postconditions are necessary to define the behavior of an ADT's operations
  completely
~ Displaying list items and replacing items do not qualify as ADT list operations, so they should be implemented
  as client functions
