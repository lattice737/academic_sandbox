~ Data management objectives:
  1) Identify useful sets of operations (e.g. abstract data types)
  2) Examine applications that use the abstract data types
  3) Construct implementations for the abstract data types (e.g. data structures & classes)
~ Data can be organized either by position or by value
~ The specification of an abstract data type that you can use to solve a particular problem can emergy during the design
  of the problem's solution
